using C#

Created a new branch and planning to add fome properties to existing human.
Decided to create another branch as want to save original App version and to try not to brake it.

Right now logic is next:
We are creating human with name, health, and it will be possible to give a commands to speak, walk, die and to find out alive it or not.
Human name will be sent to the class during using class constructor. Age and heals status are generating in the constructor automatically.
Later theyll take a part in next steps related displaying text regarding human during using available methods.
